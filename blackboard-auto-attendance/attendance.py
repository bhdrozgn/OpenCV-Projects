# Blackboard Collaborate auto raise hands if raised hands detected in some parts of the screen
# It can act as a attendance bot if lecturer takes attendance by raised hands
# One of the downside is you have to keep Blackboard on top and you have to switch to list of people instead of chat tab
# or don't obstruct the locations of the screen which the program needs
# I know that it can be wrote with less code but i didn't put too much effort on this and used some codes from my other projects and rearranged them
