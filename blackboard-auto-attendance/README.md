# blackboard-auto-attendance
* It is a program for Blackboard Collaborate to auto raise hands if raised hands detected in some parts of the screen.
* It can act as an attendance bot if lecturer takes attendance by raised hands
* One of the downsides is you have to keep Blackboard window on top, switch to list of people instead of chat tab and don't obstruct the locations of the screen which the program needs
* Don't forget to set line 46 for your case, detailed information commented in line 46
* It would be better to write it in javascript but I just wanted to try this while I'm learning OpenCV
