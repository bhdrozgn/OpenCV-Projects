# blackboard-auto-attendance
* It is a program for Blackboard Collaborate to auto raise hands if raised hands detected in some parts of the screen.
* It can act as an attendance bot if lecturer takes attendance by raised hands
* One of the downsides is you have to keep Blackboard window on top, switch to list of people instead of chat tab and don't obstruct the locations of the screen which the program needs
* Don't forget to set line 46 for your case, detailed information commented in line 46
* I know that it can be wrote with less code but i didn't put too much effort on this and used some codes from my other projects and rearranged them
